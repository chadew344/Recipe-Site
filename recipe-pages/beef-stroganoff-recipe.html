          <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>

          </li>
          <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
          <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
          <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
          <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
          <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
          <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)</li>
          <li>Cooked egg noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes (for serving)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pat the beef strips dry with a paper towel to remove excess
            moisture.
          </li>
          <li>Season the beef with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Beef</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large skillet, heat <strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong> and
            <strong>1 tbsp butter</strong> over medium-high heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the oil is hot, add the beef in batches to avoid overcrowding.
            Sauté for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until browned. Remove the
            beef from the skillet and set it aside.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Onions and Garlic</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the same skillet, add <strong>1 finely chopped onion</strong> and
            <strong>2 minced garlic cloves</strong>. Sauté until softened and
            fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Add the Mushrooms and Cook</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the <strong>200g sliced mushrooms</strong> to the skillet. Cook,
            stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden brown and
            softened, about 5-7 minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Make the Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sprinkle <strong>2 tbsp flour</strong> over the mushroom mixture and
            stir well to combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly pour in <strong>1 cup beef broth</strong>, stirring
            constantly to avoid lumps. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3-5
            minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Add the Mustard and Sour Cream</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stir in <strong>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</strong> and
            <strong>1/2 cup sour cream</strong> until the sauce becomes smooth
            and creamy. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 7: Return the Beef to the Skillet</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Return the cooked beef to the skillet, along with any juices that
            have accumulated. Stir well to coat the beef in the sauce and cook
            for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat through.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 8: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Serve the Beef Stroganoff over your choice of cooked egg noodles,
            rice, or mashed potatoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and added
            freshness.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Beef Stroganoff:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For tender beef, avoid overcooking the meat. Sautéing quickly over
            medium-high heat helps maintain its tenderness.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don’t have beef tenderloin, you can use sirloin or rib-eye,
            but make sure to slice the beef thinly against the grain.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can substitute half of the sour cream with heavy cream for a
            richer sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you prefer a thicker sauce, continue simmering until it reaches
            your desired consistency. If it’s too thick, add a splash of beef
            broth.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          Beef Stroganoff has its roots in Russian cuisine, named after the
          Stroganov family, aristocrats in 19th-century Russia. Originally, it
          was made with more luxurious ingredients like calf’s liver and served
          as a delicacy. Over time, the dish evolved into the popular version we
          know today, made with beef, mushrooms, and a rich, creamy sauce. It
          became widely known in the United States and Europe in the mid-20th
          century, where it was embraced as an elegant yet accessible dinner
          option. Today, Beef Stroganoff is enjoyed in many variations
          worldwide, but the core principles of tender beef and creamy sauce
          remain.
