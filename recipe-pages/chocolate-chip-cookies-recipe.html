        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
          <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
          <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
          <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Oven and Baking Sheets</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat your oven to <strong>350°F (175°C)</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking
            mat.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream
            <strong>1 cup unsalted butter</strong> with
            <strong>3/4 cup granulated sugar</strong> and
            <strong>3/4 cup brown sugar</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Beat the mixture until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Add in the <strong>2 tsp vanilla extract</strong> and
            <strong>2 large eggs</strong>, one at a time, beating well after
            each addition.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a separate bowl, whisk together
            <strong>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</strong>,
            <strong>1/2 tsp baking soda</strong>, and
            <strong>1/2 tsp salt</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing
            until just combined.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Add the Chocolate Chips</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stir in <strong>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</strong> until
            evenly distributed throughout the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            If desired, fold in <strong>1 cup chopped nuts</strong> (walnuts or
            pecans work great).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Shape the Cookies</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded balls of dough onto
            the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you like larger cookies, scoop out slightly bigger portions of
            dough.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cookies</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for <strong>10-12 minutes</strong>, or
            until the edges are golden brown and the centers are just set.
          </li>
          <li>
            For chewier cookies, remove them from the oven when the centers are
            still slightly soft.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 2-3 minutes
            before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve warm for that perfect melty chocolate experience, or store in
            an airtight container for up to 1 week.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Chill your cookie dough for 30 minutes before baking for thicker,
            chewier cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            For extra crispy cookies, bake them for an additional 1-2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a mix of dark and milk chocolate chips for a more complex
            flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            For softer cookies, use a bit more brown sugar than granulated
            sugar.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Healthier Alternatives:</h2>
        <p>
          While these cookies are a delicious treat, you can modify the recipe
          for a lighter version by using whole wheat flour, coconut oil, or
          replacing some of the sugar with honey or a sugar substitute. Adding
          oatmeal to the dough can also give the cookies a fiber boost, making
          them a bit healthier.
        </p>

        <h2>Occasions to Enjoy Chocolate Chip Cookies:</h2>
        <p>
          These cookies are perfect for any occasion! Whether you’re having a
          family movie night, celebrating a birthday, or simply craving
          something sweet, classic chocolate chip cookies never disappoint.
          They're also an excellent treat to pack for lunchboxes, share with
          friends at parties, or even enjoy as a late-night snack.
        </p>

        <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
        <p>
          Chocolate chip cookies were invented in the 1930s by Ruth Wakefield,
          the owner of the Toll House Inn in Massachusetts. She originally added
          chopped-up bits of chocolate into her cookie dough, not realizing they
          would melt into the dough. The rest is history, as these cookies
          quickly became a beloved treat across the world!
