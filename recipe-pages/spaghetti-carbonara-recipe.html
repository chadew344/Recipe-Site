        <p>
          Spaghetti Carbonara is a quintessential Italian pasta dish that’s
          simple, yet packed with flavor. It is made with just a few ingredients
          – <strong>spaghetti</strong>, <strong>guanciale</strong>,
          <strong>eggs</strong>, and <strong>pecorino Romano</strong> – to
          create a creamy, velvety sauce that coats every strand of pasta. The
          combination of savory guanciale, rich eggs, and tangy cheese creates a
          dish that is comforting, indulgent, and incredibly satisfying. While
          it’s a simple recipe, the technique is key to achieving the perfect
          Carbonara. This dish is a staple in Roman cuisine and loved around the
          world!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>400g spaghetti</li>
          <li>150g guanciale (or pancetta), diced</li>
          <li>4 large eggs</li>
          <li>100g pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
          <li>50g Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>Salt, for pasta water</li>
          <li>1 tbsp olive oil (optional, for sautéing guanciale)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
          <li>
            Add the <strong>400g spaghetti</strong> and cook according to the
            package instructions until al dente, about 9-10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Guanciale</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat.
            Add the <strong>150g guanciale</strong> (or pancetta) to the
            skillet.
          </li>
          <li>
            If necessary, add <strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong> to help render
            the fat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sauté the guanciale until crispy and golden brown, about 5-7
            minutes. Once done, remove from heat and set aside.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Make the Carbonara Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the <strong>4 eggs</strong>,
            <strong>100g pecorino Romano</strong>, and
            <strong>50g Parmigiano-Reggiano</strong> until smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season the mixture with freshly ground black pepper to taste. The
            pepper adds a lovely spice that enhances the creaminess of the
            sauce.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Combine Pasta and Guanciale</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add the hot spaghetti to the
            skillet with the crispy guanciale.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quickly toss the pasta with the guanciale to coat it in the rendered
            fat, ensuring the pasta is well coated.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Create the Creamy Carbonara Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta while tossing
            continuously. The residual heat from the pasta will gently cook the
            eggs and create a silky, creamy sauce. Be sure to work quickly to
            prevent scrambling the eggs.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta
            cooking water, a tablespoon at a time, until you reach your desired
            consistency.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Final Seasoning and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Taste the carbonara and adjust the seasoning with more freshly
            ground black pepper, if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the Spaghetti Carbonara immediately, garnished with extra
            grated Pecorino Romano and a sprinkle of black pepper.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Spaghetti Carbonara:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use fresh eggs for the best texture in your sauce.</li>
          <li>
            Guanciale is the traditional choice for Carbonara, but pancetta can
            be used as a substitute if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t add the egg mixture too early – the heat from the pasta should
            gently cook the eggs to form a creamy sauce, not scramble them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reserve plenty of pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency as
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be careful not to overcook the pasta; it should be al dente, as it
            will continue to cook when mixed with the hot guanciale and eggs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Spaghetti Carbonara is a Classic:</h2>
        <p>
          Spaghetti Carbonara is a staple of Roman cuisine, dating back to at
          least the mid-20th century. Its roots are often debated, but it’s
          believed to have been invented by Italian charcoal workers in central
          Italy. The dish is considered a symbol of the Italian tradition of
          using few, high-quality ingredients to create bold and flavorful
          meals. With its creamy texture, savory guanciale, and rich flavors,
          it’s no wonder Spaghetti Carbonara continues to be one of the most
          popular pasta dishes in the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Variations of Carbonara:</h2>
        <p>
          While the classic version of Carbonara sticks to the traditional
          ingredients, many people love experimenting with different variations.
          Some common tweaks include adding peas for a touch of sweetness, using
          different cheeses like Parmesan or Asiago, or even adding a hint of
          garlic to the sauce. While purists may argue, these variations are fun
          ways to make the dish your own!
