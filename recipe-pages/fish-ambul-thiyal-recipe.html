        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Sri Lankan Fish Ambul Thiyal is a classic dish that beautifully blends
          the flavors of <strong>tamarind</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>,
          <strong>curry leaves</strong>, and <strong>spices</strong> to create a
          savory, tangy curry that pairs perfectly with steamed rice. The fish
          is cooked until tender in a rich, aromatic sauce made with a unique
          blend of spices, creating a deep and flavorful curry. This is a staple
          in Sri Lankan homes and is often served during special occasions or as
          a comforting, everyday meal.

          <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
          <li>Water as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Marinate the Fish</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place the fish pieces in a bowl and season with salt, 1 tbsp curry
            powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1 tsp turmeric powder. Mix well to
            coat the fish with the spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the fish marinate for 15-20 minutes to absorb the flavors.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Aromatics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat <strong>2 tbsp oil</strong> in a large pan over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and minced ginger. Sauté until
            the onions turn soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the sliced green chilies, curry leaves, and cinnamon stick, and
            sauté for another 2 minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Add the Tamarind and Spices</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the <strong>tamarind paste</strong> to the pan and mix well with
            the onions and spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the remaining <strong>1 tbsp curry powder</strong> and
            <strong>1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds</strong>, and stir everything
            together.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Add the Fish</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gently add the marinated fish pieces into the pan, ensuring the fish
            is covered in the tamarind and spice mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in enough water to cover the fish, then bring to a simmer. Let
            the fish cook for 15-20 minutes until the fish is cooked through and
            tender.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Add Coconut Milk</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stir in the <strong>1 cup coconut milk</strong> and let the curry
            simmer for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and
            the sauce to thicken slightly.
          </li>
          <li>Check the seasoning and adjust salt as needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Remove from heat and serve the Fish Ambul Thiyal with a side of
            <strong>steamed rice</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Garnish with a few extra curry leaves if desired, and enjoy the
            tangy, flavorful curry.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Fish Ambul Thiyal:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use firm, meaty fish like tuna or swordfish, which hold their shape
            well in the curry.
          </li>
          <li>
            If tamarind paste is not available, you can use tamarind concentrate
            or fresh tamarind pulp.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the level of spiciness by adding more or fewer green chilies.
          </li>
          <li>
            For extra richness, you can add a bit more coconut milk towards the
            end of cooking.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          Fish Ambul Thiyal is one of the most iconic dishes in Sri Lankan
          cuisine. Known for its tangy, spicy flavor, it’s often considered a
          comforting, soul-warming dish in Sri Lankan homes. Traditionally, it
          is made with fish caught fresh from the sea, reflecting the island's
          deep connection to the ocean. The use of tamarind and aromatic spices
          adds complexity to the flavor profile, making it a true Sri Lankan
          delicacy.
